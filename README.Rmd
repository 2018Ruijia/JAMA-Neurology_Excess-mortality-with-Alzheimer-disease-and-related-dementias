This is reproducible code and data for our JAMA Neurology paper, [*Excess mortality with Alzheimer disease and related dementias as an underlying or contributing cause during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US*](doi:10.1001/jamaneurol.2023.2226), which uses the [CDC WONDER provisional data](https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd.html) to compare pandemic-era excess deaths associated with ADRD between year 1 and year 2 overall and by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and place of death.

### Abstract
IMPORTANCE: Adults with Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) are particularly vulnerable to the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Deaths associated with ADRD increased substantially in pandemic year 1. It is unclear whether mortality associated with ADRD declined when better prevention strategies, testing, and vaccines became widely available in year 2. 
OBJECTIVE: To compare pandemic-era excess deaths associated with ADRD between year 1 and year 2 overall and by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and place of death. 
DESIGN: Retrospective, time series analysis of death certificate data (2014-2022).
SETTING: Nationwide study of US deaths. 
PARTICIPANTS: US decedents aged 65 years and older with ADRD as an underlying or contributing cause of death from 2014 through February 2022 (N = 2,334,101 deaths).
Exposure(s): Covid-19 pandemic era
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Pandemic-era excess deaths associated with ADRD were defined as the difference between deaths with ADRD as an underlying or contributing cause observed from March 2020 to February 2021 (year 1) and March 2021 to February 2022 (year 2) compared to expected deaths during this period. Expected deaths were estimated using data from January 2014 to February 2020 fitted with autoregressive integrated moving average models.  
RESULTS: We estimated 94,688 (95% PI, 84,192-104,891) pandemic-era excess deaths with ADRD in year 1 and 21,586 (95% PI, 10,631-32,450) in year 2. Declines in ADRD-related deaths in year 2 were substantial for every age, sex, and racial and ethnic group evaluated. Pandemic-era ADRD-related excess deaths declined among nursing home/long-term care (NH/LTC) residents (from 34,259 (95% PI, 25,819 - 42,677) in year 1 to -22,050 (95% PI, -30,765 −  -13,273) in year 2), but excess deaths at home remained high (from 34,487 (95% PI, 32,815 - 36,142)  in year 1 to 28,804 (95% PI, 27,067- 30,571)  in year 2). 
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Large increases in mortality with ADRD as an underlying or contributing cause of death occurred in pandemic year 1 but were largely mitigated in pandemic year 2. The most pronounced declines were observed for deaths in NH/LTC. Conversely, excess deaths at home and in medical facilities remained high in year 2.




## Reproducibility 

All analyses are conducted using `R`, which can be [downloaded via CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). 
We also recommend the use of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) when running `R`, which will allow users to take advantage of [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) for dependency management. If not using
`renv`, we provide session information at the end of this file to ensure packages are
the correct version. Note that for the joinpoint analyses, you must use an external program, [Joinpoint Regression Program](https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/) which can be downloaded from the National Cancer Institute website. 

We use publicly available data — the `README.md` file in `data_raw` has links to our CDC WONDER query and each query file has the dates of data access. 

The code files (in `code`) are designed to be run in order.
